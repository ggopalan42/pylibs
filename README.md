Giri Gopalans Extensive Python Libraries

This repo contains libraries developed by me for a wide variety of
technologies. The main goal is reuse of code.

## The Libraries
- [Cloud](cloud)     Mostly AWS now, but hopefully others
- Infrastructure:   [Things like databases, docker, etc.](infra)
- Input/Output:     [File utilities, logging, etc.](io)
- Machine Learning: [Data pre-processing, various models and the like](ml)
