Giri Gopalans Extensive Python Libraries

This repo contains libraries developed by me for a wide variety of
technologies. The main goal is reuse of code.

## The Libraries
- [Cloud](cloud):  Mostly AWS now, but hopefully others
- [Infrastructure](infra):  Things like databases, docker, etc.
- [Input/Output](io):  File utilities, logging, etc.
- [Machine Learning](ml):  Data pre-processing, various models and the like
